## The database

I am not the athor of the database. The data has extract in a public dataset in [Mendely](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/v2jrv3s58c/1).

Song, Chi-Hoon (2020), “Dataset for SEM and ANN analysis in cloud computing acceptance”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/v2jrv3s58c.1

I will not upload the file with the data, download it from the article's website and add it to the data/raw folder.

## The code

The selected method for implementing the SEM model is Partial Least Squares (PLS), a statistical technique for fitting a function's best line or curve. PLS is also used in linear regression, where we try to fit a straight line to the data to predict or model relationships between variables. The PLS is implemented in seminr.
